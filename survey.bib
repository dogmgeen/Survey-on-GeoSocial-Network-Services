	abstract = {{GeoSocial} Networks ({GSNs}) are online social networks centered on the location information of their users. Users “check-in” their location and use it to acquire location-based special status (e.g., badges, mayorships) and receive venue dependent rewards. The strategy of rewarding user participation however makes cheating a profitable behavior. In this paper we introduce {XACT}, a suite of venue-oriented secure location verification mechanisms that enable venues and {GSN} providers to certify the locations claimed by users. We prove that {XACT} is correct, secure and easy to use. We validate the need for secure location verification mechanisms by collecting and analyzing data from the most popular {GSNs} today: 780,000 Foursquare users and 143,000 Gowalla users. Through a proof-of-concept implementation on a Revision C4 {BeagleBoard} embedded system we show that {XACT} is easy to deploy and economically viable. We analytically and empirically prove that {XACT} detects location cheating attacks.},

Its reliance on user profiles, built from a wealth of voluntarily revealed personal information, exposes users to a variety of privacy vulnerabilities.

We introduce {PROFILR}, a framework for constructing location centric profiles ({LCPs}), aggregates built over the profiles of users that have visited discrete locations (i.e., venues). {PROFILR} endows users with strong privacy guarantees and providers with correctness assurances. In addition to a venue centric approach, we propose a decentralized solution for computing real time {LCP} snapshots over the profiles of colocated users. An Android implementation shows that {PROFILR} is efficient; the end-to-end overhead is small even under strong privacy and correctness assurances.},

Boasting millions of users and tens of millions of daily check-ins, such services pose significant privacy threats: user location information may be tracked and leaked to third parties. Conversely, a solution enabling location privacy may provide cheating capabilities to users wanting to claim special location status. In this paper we introduce new mechanisms that allow users to (inter)act privately in today's geosocial networks while simultaneously ensuring honest behavior. An Android implementation is provided.

In order to recommend satisfying itinerary to users, we present an itinerary model in terms of attributes extracted from user-generated {GPS} trajectories. On top of this itinerary model, we present a social itinerary recommendation framework to find and rank itinerary candidates. We evaluated the efficiency of our recommendation method against baseline algorithms with a large set of user-generated {GPS} trajectories collected from Beijing, China. First, systematically generated user queries are used to compare the recommendation performance in the algorithmic level. Second, a user study involving current residents of Beijing is conducted to compare user perception and satisfaction on the recommended itinerary. Third, we compare mobile-only approach with Mobile+Cloud architecture for practical mobile recommender deployment. Lastly, we discuss personalization and adaptation factors in social itinerary recommendation throughout the paper.},

To this end, we propose several privacy preserving protocols that enable users to prove having satisfied the conditions of several badge types.

This proximity service is usually offered by the network itself or by a third party service provider ({SP}) using location data acquired from the users. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical and experimental analysis of the existing solutions for the location privacy problem in proximity services. This is a serious problem for users who do not trust the {SP} to handle their location data and would only like to release their location information in a generalized form to participating buddies. The paper presents two new protocols providing complete privacy with respect to the {SP} and controllable privacy with respect to the buddies. The analytical and experimental analysis of the protocols takes into account privacy, service precision, and computation and communication costs, showing the superiority of the new protocols compared to those appeared in the literature to date. The proposed protocols have also been tested in a full system implementation of the proximity service.},

In this paper, we introduce {LocX}, a novel alternative that provides significantly improved location privacy without adding uncertainty into query results or relying on strong assumptions about server security. Our key insight is to apply secure user-specific, distance-preserving coordinate transformations to all location data shared with the server. The friends of a user share this user's secrets so they can apply the same transformation. This allows all location queries to be evaluated correctly by the server, but our privacy mechanisms guarantee that servers are unable to see or infer the actual location data from the transformed data or from the data access. We show that {LocX} provides privacy even against a powerful adversary model, and we use prototype measurements to show that it provides privacy with very little performance overhead, making it suitable for today's mobile devices.},

In this work, we focus on personalized travel recommendation by leveraging the freely available community-contributed photos. We propose to conduct personalized travel recommendation by further considering specific user profiles or attributes (e.g., gender, age, race). In stead of mining photo logs only, we argue to leverage the automatically detected people attributes in the photo contents. By information-theoretic measures, we will demonstrate that such people attributes are informative and effective for travel recommendation -- especially providing a promising aspect for personalization. We effectively mine the demographics for different locations (or landmarks) and travel paths. A probabilistic Bayesian learning framework which further entails mobile recommendation on the spot is introduced. We experiment on four million photos collected for eight major worldwide cities. The experiments confirm that people attributes are promising and orthogonal to prior works using travel logs only and can further improve prior travel recommendation methods especially in difficult predictions by further leveraging user contexts in mobile devices.},

	abstract = {As a result of significantly growing competition from online-only retailers, physical store retailers have resorted to measures such as discount coupons, online price matching, sale events, and a seamless omnichannel customer experience. One important, often overlooked method is partner-marketing, where a retailer promotes products or services offered by other merchants. The main challenge in partner-marketing is finding partners, i.e., determining whom a retailer should choose as partners among many choices. In this paper, we discuss how a retailer can make use of rich information from mobile and geo-social media to find potential partners in a geographic region. The explosion of mobile and geo-social media in recent years has led to increasing insights about consumers' footprints—which shops they visit, where they travel, and where they live and work. In addition, geo-social data also reveals which regional merchants are popular and why. We propose a series of partner-finding techniques that leverage geo-social data at increasing granularity and discuss analytics to rank potential partners. We present compelling business case studies using real data from Foursquare, a social networking website. We also discuss how retailers can combine geo-social data with traditional data such as demographics, weather information, and their own marketing databases to personalize partner-marketing.},

This study aims to leverage the wealth of these enriched online photos to analyze people’s travel patterns at the local level of a tour destination. Specifically, we focus our analysis on two aspects: (1) tourist movement patterns in relation to the regions of attractions ({RoA}), and (2) topological characteristics of travel routes by different tourists. To do so, we first build a statistically reliable database of travel paths from a noisy pool of community-contributed geotagged photos on the Internet. We then investigate the tourist traffic flow among different {RoAs} by exploiting the Markov chain model. Finally, the topological characteristics of travel routes are analyzed by performing a sequence clustering on tour routes. Testings on four major cities demonstrate promising results of the proposed system.},

	abstract = {The popularity of location-based social networks provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their location histories. In this paper, we present a location-based and preference-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (such as restaurants) within a geospatial range with the consideration of both: 1) User preferences, which are automatically learned from her location history and 2) Social opinions, which are mined from the location histories of the local experts. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near their living areas but also to a city that is new to them. As a user can only visit a limited number of locations, the user-locations matrix is very sparse, leading to a big challenge to traditional collaborative filtering-based location recommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people travel to a new city. To this end, we propose a novel location recommender system, which consists of two main parts: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part models each individual's personal preferences with a weighted category hierarchy ({WCH}) and infers the expertise of each user in a city with respect to different category of locations according to their location histories using an iterative learning model. The online recommendation part selects candidate local experts in a geospatial range that matches the user's preferences using a preference-aware candidate selection algorithm and then infers a score of the candidate locations based on the opinions of the selected local experts. Finally, the top-k ranked locations are returned as the recommendations for the user. We evaluated our system with a large-scale real dataset collected from Foursquare. The results confirm that our method offers more effective recommendations than baselines, while having a good efficiency of providing location recommendations.},

Traditional recommender systems do not consider spatial properties of users nor items, {LARS}, on the other hand, supports a taxonomy of three novel classes of location-based ratings, namely, spatial ratings for non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial ratings for spatial items. {LARS} exploits user rating locations through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation quality. {LARS} exploits item locations using travel penalty, a technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all spatial items. {LARS} can apply these techniques separately, or in concert, depending on the type of location-based rating available. Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the Foursquare location-based social network and the Movie Lens movie recommendation system reveals that {LARS} is efficient, scalable, and capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to existing recommendation approaches.},

	abstract = {The problem of identifying the optimal location for a new retail store has been the focus of past research, especially in the field of land economy, due to its importance in the success of a business. Traditional approaches to the problem have factored in demographics, revenue and aggregated human flow statistics from nearby or remote areas. However, the acquisition of relevant data is usually expensive. With the growth of location-based social networks, fine grained data describing user mobility and popularity of places has recently become attainable. In this paper we study the predictive power of various machine learning features on the popularity of retail stores in the city through the use of a dataset collected from Foursquare in New York. The features we mine are based on two general signals: geographic, where features are formulated according to the types and density of nearby places, and user mobility, which includes transitions between venues or the incoming flow of mobile users from distant areas. Our evaluation suggests that the best performing features are common across the three different commercial chains considered in the analysis, although variations may exist too, as explained by heterogeneities in the way retail facilities attract users. We also show that performance improves significantly when combining multiple features in supervised learning algorithms, suggesting that the retail success of a business may depend on multiple factors.},

We first show the distinct characteristics of such f2f groups by analyzing datasets collected from Whrrl and Meetup. Next, we propose a dynamic model for group gathering based on the process of friend invitation to interpret how a f2f group is formed on-line. The results of our model are confirmed by empirical observations. Finally, we demonstrate that using such group information can effectively improve the accuracies of social tie inference and friend recommendation.},

	abstract = {Even though human movement and mobility patterns have a high degree of freedom and variation, they also exhibit structural patterns due to geographic and social constraints. Using cell phone location data, as well as data from two online location-based social networks, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human motion and dynamics. We find that humans experience a combination of periodic movement that is geographically limited and seemingly random jumps correlated with their social networks. Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more influenced by social network ties. We show that social relationships can explain about 10\% to 30\% of all human movement, while periodic behavior explains 50\% to 70\%. Based on our findings, we develop a model of human mobility that combines periodic short range movements with travel due to the social network structure. We show that our model reliably predicts the locations and dynamics of future human movement and gives an order of magnitude better performance than present models of human mobility.},

	abstract = {Link prediction systems have been largely adopted to recommend new friends in online social networks using data about social interactions. With the soaring adoption of location-based social services it becomes possible to take advantage of an additional source of information: the places people visit. In this paper we study the problem of designing a link prediction system for online location-based social networks. We have gathered extensive data about one of these services, Gowalla, with periodic snapshots to capture its temporal evolution. We study the link prediction space, finding that about 30\% of new links are added among "place-friends", i.e., among users who visit the same places. We show how this prediction space can be made 15 times smaller, while still 66\% of future connections can be discovered. Thus, we define new prediction features based on the properties of the places visited by users which are able to discriminate potential future links among them. Building on these findings, we describe a supervised learning framework which exploits these prediction features to predict new links among friends-of-friends and place-friends. Our evaluation shows how the inclusion of information about places and related user activity offers high link prediction performance. These results open new directions for real-world link recommendation systems on location-based social networks.},

In addition to deriving user preference based on user-based collaborative filtering and exploring social influence from friends, we put a special emphasis on geographical influence due to the spatial clustering phenomenon exhibited in user check-in activities of {LBSNs}. We argue that the geographical influence among {POIs} plays an important role in user check-in behaviors and model it by power law distribution. Accordingly, we develop a collaborative recommendation algorithm based on geographical influence based on naive Bayesian. Furthermore, we propose a unified {POI} recommendation framework, which fuses user preference to a {POI} with social influence and geographical influence. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation over two large-scale datasets collected from Foursquare and Whrrl. Experimental results with these real datasets show that the unified collaborative recommendation approach significantly outperforms a wide spectrum of alternative recommendation approaches.},

	abstract = {The booming industry of location-based services has accumulated a huge collection of users' location trajectories of driving, cycling, hiking, etc. In this work, we investigate the problem of discovering the Most Popular Route ({MPR}) between two locations by observing the traveling behaviors of many previous users. This new query is beneficial to travelers who are asking directions or planning a trip in an unfamiliar city/area, as historical traveling experiences can reveal how people usually choose routes between locations. To achieve this goal, we firstly develop a Coherence Expanding algorithm to retrieve a transfer network from raw trajectories, for indicating all the possible movements between locations. After that, the Absorbing Markov Chain model is applied to derive a reasonable transfer probability for each transfer node in the network, which is subsequently used as the popularity indicator in the search phase. Finally, we propose a Maximum Probability Product algorithm to discover the {MPR} from a transfer network based on the popularity indicators in a breadth-first manner, and we illustrate the results and performance of the algorithm by extensive experiments.},

	abstract = {The advances in location-acquisition technologies have led to a myriad of spatial trajectories. These trajectories are usually generated at a low or an irregular frequency due to applications' characteristics or energy saving, leaving the routes between two consecutive points of a single trajectory uncertain (called an uncertain trajectory). In this paper, we present a Route Inference framework based on Collective Knowledge (abbreviated as {RICK}) to construct the popular routes from uncertain trajectories. Explicitly, given a location sequence and a time span, the {RICK} is able to construct the top-k routes which sequentially pass through the locations within the specified time span, by aggregating such uncertain trajectories in a mutual reinforcement way (i.e., uncertain + uncertain → certain). Our work can benefit trip planning, traffic management, and animal movement studies. The {RICK} comprises two components: routable graph construction and route inference. First, we explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of uncertain trajectories and construct a routable graph by collaborative learning among the uncertain trajectories. Second, in light of the routable graph, we propose a routing algorithm to construct the top-k routes according to a user-specified query. We have conducted extensive experiments on two real datasets, consisting of Foursquare check-in datasets and taxi trajectories. The results show that {RICK} is both effective and efficient.},

	abstract = {With the growing use of location-based services, location privacy attracts increasing attention from users, industry, and the research community. While considerable effort has been devoted to inventing techniques that prevent service providers from knowing a user's exact location, relatively little attention has been paid to enabling so-called peer-wise privacy---the protection of a user's location from unauthorized peer users. This paper identifies an important efficiency problem in existing peer-privacy approaches that simply apply a filtering step to identify users that are located in a query range, but that do not want to disclose their location to the querying peer. To solve this problem, we propose a novel, privacy-policy enabled index called the {PEB}-tree that seamlessly integrates location proximity and policy compatibility. We propose efficient algorithms that use the {PEB}-tree for processing privacy-aware range and {kNN} queries. Extensive experiments suggest that the {PEB}-tree enables efficient query processing.},
